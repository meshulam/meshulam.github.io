title: Give Better
---

At the first Chicago [Tech Solidarity](https://techsolidarity.org/) event in
January, someone gave a lightning talk about donating to charitable causes and
developing a giving plan. That talk made me realize how insufficient my own
approach to charity has been, and spurred me to research and craft a
plan for myself.

From informal conversations with friends, I realized that I wasn't the only
Millennial Urban Professional (or *Muppie*) that had underdeveloped philanthropy
skills. My hope is that this post will encourage other similarly priviliged
folks to allocate more resources to affect positive change in the world, and to
maximize the impact of those allocations.

*Note: I mainly talk about monetary giving in this post, but many of the ideas
apply equally well to giving other resources, such as your time.*


### Thinking about giving

* You have the power and resources to contribute to causes that make the world a
  better place according to your values
* The nature and magnitude of these contributions will differ person-to-person
* You should view charitable giving as a foundational component of
  how you make an impact on the world

### How much to give

The most important part of a giving plan is deciding your total giving budget.
An annual top-line amount means that you don't need to weigh any individual
donation against your day-to-day expenses, just against the opportunity cost of
donating to another cause. This should encourage you to think about the impact
of each donation, plus you get the satisfaction of a [United Way
thermometer](https://www.google.com/search?q=united+way+thermometer)-style
progress bar as you allocate from your budget.

So what's the right amount? Everyone's situation is different, so this is
obviously a personal decision. But as an anchor point, **budget around 10% of
your income to charitible causes**.

If you already give that much, then great! Maybe consider giving more. If you're
like me, this might sound like a lot. 
[Tithing 10%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithe) is a common practice in
western religions. Individual wealth and quality of life have increased
dramatically since tithing became a thing, so in general it should be easier
to achieve in this century.

Some other thoughts for the quantitatively minded:

* For US taxpayers, you're in the tax deduction zone if your qualified expenses
  (donations, state income tax, some interest payments) are more than the
  standard deduction (~$6300/year if you're single).  Tax law is complicated and
  I'm not a tax professional, but in general, once you get over the hump into
  itemizing deductions, it costs less than a dollar to donate a dollar. Use that
  leverage!
* Just like income taxes, you should have a higher marginal percentage for
  giving. If you get a raise or a bonus, set aside a higher proportion of that
  extra income.


### Selecting causes

There are various dimensions and criteria you can use for deciding which causes
to support:

* Issues: health, poverty, arts, civil rights, etc.
* Scope: what communities or geographic areas are benefitted?
* Means of impact: direct service/action, training or investment, research,
  advocacy, etc.

I took a portfolio approach and chose a handful of high-level causes for the bulk
of my giving budget. I left some in a *miscellaneous* category for more reactionary
donations. Some of the causes were based off organizations I already donate to,
and others were areas that I decided were important, but haven't yet
decided on a specific organization.

And of course I made a spreadsheet. Here's what it looks like with a $6000
budget:

*Strategic giving* is a term that's usually applied to larger foundations, but
the idea makes sense for anyone who wants to be more deliberate with their
donations. [This writeup](http://calvinedwardscompany.com/What%20is%20Strategic%20Giving.pdf)
gives a good overview of the concept.


### Selecting organizations


[Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/) rates many charities on
two axes: financials and accountability/transparency. They don't try to evaluate
overall impact, but their [in-depth
reports](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=3247)
are a great resource for vetting organizations.

[GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org/) is sort of like The Wirecutter for
charities. They recommend a short list of organizations that they determine
deliver the highest impact per dollar. They skew toward international public
health and anti-poverty initiatives.
