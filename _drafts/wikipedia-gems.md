Over the years I've come across quite a few interesting pages on Wikipedia, often some sort of list. Some of the best:

**[List of collective nouns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_collective_nouns_by_subject_A-H) ([Permalink](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_collective_nouns_by_subject_A-H&oldid=430339768 "Permalink"))**

The corresponding [I-Z page](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_collective_nouns_by_subject_I-Z&oldid=431015971) is quite sparse, but it's talk page features one good tidbit:

> As it says on the Wikipedia article for minyan, it is not a general term for a group of Jews, in the same way that a flock describes a group of birds in a very general way. Rather, it refers to the necessary quorum for certain ritual activities. It is still a collective noun, and it does count Jews, but not in a general term sort of way.

**[List of cognitive biases ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)([Permalink](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_cognitive_biases&oldid=431359323))**

A list of ways in which we are inferior to robots.

 

**[Human Extinction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_extinction) ([Permalink](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_extinction&oldid=431467889))**

Perhaps not technically a list, it still deserves a mention. Whenever you're feeling really happy and carefree, you can read this article to put everything back into perspective.

 

**[List of lists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_lists) ([Permalink](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Lists_of_lists&oldid=430663154))**

The ultimate meta-list.

 

[Bad words list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lupin/badwords)

[](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lupin/badwords)A collection of bad words that is used for vandalism detection on Wikipedia. Some knowledge of regular expressions helps with this one. But even if you don't understand the syntax, I hope you can appreciate the poetry of an entry like:

/(m[ou]th[ae]r?)?(f+|ph)W*(u+W*(kc|[c(]+W*k*|c*W*k+|x)|cuk)(a|in[g']?|e[rd]|y|)?[sz]?(m(e|y)|(yo)?ur?|his|her|it|their|our|each other)?[- ]?(ass|all|ie|y|bitch|erino|head|hole|arse|face|queer|w?it|[o0]r?|off|tard|wad|(yo)?u|me|her|him|them)?(a|e+[rsd]|in[g']?)?(a| hell| and die|him|her|up)?[sz]?/
