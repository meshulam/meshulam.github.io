One of the parts of being the production manager at the [Gargoyle](http://www.thegargoylestl.com/) is getting unsolicited emails from artists and booking agents who want to do a show at our venue. Since we have a dedicated "booking" email address on our site, any time I get an email like that it's usually not the most professional operation.

Which brings me to the most recent booking inquiry I've received. The full email and attached poster:

Subject: Micro Wrestling Federation LIVE @ The Gargoyle!!!> 
> Hello, my name is Miguel.  I work for a pro midget wrestling show called the Micro Wrestling Federation . The Micro event is a full scale WWE type event with a professional size wrestling ring and an all midget cast.
> 
> The show is one of a kind and we average 500+ fans per show. I have plenty of references that have had sell outs and I wanted to see if I could talk to someone who does your bookings.
> 
> Check out the video clip on the home page of our website below.  You will be able to see about 10 different venues that have had the Micro event in 2008.  You will get a good idea of how the ring is set up and how the crowd stands around the ring.  Also notice the crowd is 50-50 guys and girls.  The people that come and see the Micro event aren't coming to see wrestling......they are coming to see midgets!  Thanks.

> P.S. We were @ the Bar and Nightclub Convention this year and no one had more people visit their booth than us.

Their website is [www.microwrestling.com](http://www.microwrestling.com), if you're interested. I think this is better than our reigning champion of booking inquiries, the Elvis impersonator festival.
