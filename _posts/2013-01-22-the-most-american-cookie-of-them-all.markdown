Discussion topic: What kind of cookie best represents the United States?

At work, the product managers have started taking turns bringing in baked goods every Wednesday. The lazier ones among us just buy something at the store, but for my first Wednesday [fika](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fika_(coffee_break)) I naturally wanted to bring a home-baked treat. One of my coworkers suggested I bring "something American", which got me pondering the above question.

So back to the question at hand. If you said chocolate chip cookies, come on. Be a little creative. My answer?

Oatmeal-peanut butter Breakfast Cookies based off [this recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/hearty-breakfast-cookies/). Unfortunately I didn't have my mom's recipe for these cookies; that one is much better. But the idea is the same. So what makes breakfast cookies the most American cookies? Several reasons:

- Peanut butter. In the U.S. we don't really consider PB to be typically American, but that's how the rest of the world sees it. In fact, more than one Swede has asked me why Americans like peanut butter so much. They just don't get it. Furthermore, it's in the international section of the grocery stores here. George Washington Carver would be proud.
- Mix-ins. While the linked recipe just calls for raisins, I also included M&Ms, and the real recipe throws in chocolate chips too for an all-out attack of texture and flavor. I don't have any strong argument for why mix-ins are American, but it just feels right, doesn't it?
- And of course the obvious one: Who else but Americans would have the audacity to suggest that [cookies are a suitable breakfast food](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6EO2zVsIfs)? And then this cookie goes and puts it right in its name!

To drive home the whole American thing, I made mine extra large. I will see how they go over with the Swedes tomorrow.
