A pop-up notification from Google Calendar:

> Turn in timesheet (Matt Meshulam) is starting at 12:30pm in timesheet

Google uses some simple text parsing to attempt to determine the time and location of an event you enter. In this case, I typed "Turn in timesheet." My intended meaning was "I must submit my timesheet." Google interpreted my text as "You must go to some place called Timesheet, and when you get there, you have to turn."

The singularity is not yet upon us.
