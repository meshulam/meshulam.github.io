I recently picked up a laboratory wash bottle atÂ [American Science and Surplus](http://www.sciplus.com/singleItem.cfm/terms/12429). I don't know if it's just the convenience of not having to lift up the bottle and turn it upside down, but I've almost been enjoying the dish washing experience lately. Best $3.75 I've ever spent.
