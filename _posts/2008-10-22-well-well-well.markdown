A few days ago, I discovered a great new way to talk to my friends called "text-messaging." No sooner do I thumb out my first "text," or "txt" for short, when I hear of an even more hep way to communicate. And so I find myself here.

More accurately, I've decided to start a blog, as you can probably tell. Not sure what will be contained within, but I imagine it to be a general sort of brain dump, as the title indicates. And so, the great experiment begins!
