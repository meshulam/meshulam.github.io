I'm a big fan of the [TED conference](http://www.ted.com) and am grateful that they post their videos online. I just watched the TED talk of John Hodgeman, expert on everything. It's very funny.

[TED Talk: John Hodgeman's brief digression](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/john_hodgman_s_brief_digression.html)

So this is what I'm supposed to do when I can't think of something to write, right? Just link to a video? Okay, cool.
