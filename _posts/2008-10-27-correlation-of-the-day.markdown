According to [the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/oct/27/acdc-music-recession), every major economic recession in England has occurred around the time of an AC/DC album release. The correlation is staggering:

> 1973: **AC/DC** form in Sydney, Australia.  
> **Economy: **Start of the oil crisis, which saw the price quadruple
> 
> 1980: **AC/DC **release breakthrough album Back In Black  
> **Economy: **Inflation in UK reaches 20% and unemployment nears 2 million
> 
> 1990: **AC/DC **score comeback with The Razor's Edge  
> **Economy: **Recession in UK imminent
> 
> 2008: **AC/DC **top UK album charts  
> **Economy: **Biggest world recession in decades looms

This is the most important discovery in correlation science since it was found that pirates prevent global warming:
