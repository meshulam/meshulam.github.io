For the past month I was on something of a detox diet: I gave up alcohol, caffeine, and meat, and for the last three days I was a raw vegan. Some notes about the raw experience:

- Even though I typically eat pretty healthy, it's been quite a few years since I've followed any strict rules about what I can eat. I like to think of myself as a [perfect omnivore](http://www.slate.com/id/3152/), so abiding by my arbitrary guidelines made me think about eating in a different way than I'm used to.
- I didn't feel hungry in the way I anticipated when eating raw food. On the first day my body was definitely a little confused, but I was eating large meals so my stomach was physically full. I didn't find myself snacking any more or less than I usually do.
- I estimated I was only consuming about 1500 Calories per day--probably less than half of what I normally eat. I'd consider following a raw diet for a longer time, like a week or two, but I'd need to find better ways to maintain my body weight.
- Over half of my caloric intake was from fat; mainly from nuts, avocado, and olive oil (technically raw but admittedly not in the spirit of a raw vegan diet). I don't know if it's really a problem; that's about the same proportion as a typical junk food diet, just with significantly less saturated fat.
- I wasn't expecting to lose my meat-digesting abilities/enzymes after just a month, but I'm definitely going to need to ease back into it. I'll spare you the details, but even my second attempt at eating meat (~6 ounces of chicken as part of a vegetable/grain-heavy meal) produced an adverse reaction.
- The grammar Nazi inside me died a little every time I used "raw" as an adverb or to describe a person. But "I'm eating rawly" and "you're rawtarian, right?" don't really work either, so I'll let it slide.
