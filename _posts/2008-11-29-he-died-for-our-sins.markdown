I'm sure that at this point everybody has heard about Jdimytai Damour, the temp employee who was killed by a herd of overly eager Black Friday shoppers at a New York Wal-Mart yesterday morning. The metaphors that can be drawn from the incident are pretty obvious, but I still had to point out the final paragraph in a [follow-up article](http://apnews.myway.com/article/20081129/D94OJ4NG0.html) from the Associated Press:

> Items on sale at the Valley Stream Wal-Mart included a Samsung 50-inch Plasma HDTV for $798, a Bissel Compact Upright Vacuum for $28, a Samsung 10.2 megapixel digital camera for $69 and DVDs such as "The Incredible Hulk" for $9.

If I recall correctly from my middle-school newspaper days, the last paragraph of a news article often provides additional background information relevant to the story that doesn't fit into the overall narrative of the piece. Did the author choose to report these Wal-Mart rollbacks to help readers decide if the death was justified? You make me sick, Associated Press correspondent Colleen Long.
