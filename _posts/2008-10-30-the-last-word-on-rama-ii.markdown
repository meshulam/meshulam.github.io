As I mentioned [previously](/2008/10/arthur-c-clarkes-economic-premonition/), I'm reading *Rama II* by Arthur C. Clarke and Gentry Lee. I enjoyed its prequel, *Rendezvous With Rama*, which is probably the most hardcore science fiction I've read. There's pretty much no character development, just page after glorious page of describing a mysterious giant alien spacecraft that found its way into our solar system. Which explains why I was a bit shocked when *Rama II* turned out to be much more of a space opera, complete with love triangles, secret poisonings, and robots that quote Shakespeare. But I hung in there, savoring the bits of true sci-fi that were few and far between.

But now it's gone too far. I can no longer take this novel seriously. *Rama II* has [jumped the shark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark). I know what you're thinking, "Matt, you're just being dramatic." But I'm not. ****

**Background information**: Rama is a massive space vessel from an alien civilization, a cylinder kilometers in each dimension.

**The scene in question**: Two members of the human crew sent to explore it get stuck for days on an island in a sea inside Rama. They finally formulate a plan to escape the island by harnessing birdlike aliens that they discover. Sirs Clarke, Lee, care to take it from here?

> Nicole sat in her harness, her hands holding on to two of the three lines, her feet dangling below her about eight meters from the tops of the waves.
> 
> The middle of the sea was quite calm. About halfway across Nicole saw two great, dark figures swimming beneath her, parallel to her course. **She was certain they were shark biots.** [emphasis added]

They literally jumped the sharks! And they were robotic sharks, no less! When a series so blatantly jumps the shark, I just lose all respect for it. I certainly will not be reading *The Garden of Rama* or *Rama Revealed*.
