I just got back from a week-long trip to Spain. I traveled around to Granada, Sevilla, and Barcelona. The highlight of the trip was seeing the [Sagrada Familia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia), a church designed by Antoni Gaudi in the 1880s-1920s. The building's design is unlike anything I've ever seen; it's described as "neo-gothic" but that doesn't really express the uniqueness of it. The most interesting thing, though, is that it's still being built, and isn't expected to be completed until the late 2020s. I guess I just admire the outrageous ambitiousness of the project. Anyways, here's some photos from the trip.
