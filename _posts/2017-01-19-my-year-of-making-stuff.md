title: My Year of Making Stuff
---

In 2016 I worked on a ridiculously broad range of projects, both for work and
independently. Sometimes I forget projects or things I learned a while ago, so I decided
to write up a summary of the highlights.

* I started the year writing Scala and Javascript at TempoIQ, which was
  incredibly my first time working as an official software engineer. It was the perfect startup
  experience: constantly learning and building cool things and culminating in an
  underwhelming acqui-hire.
* My brief time at the acquiring company was in Ruby on Rails.
  It was a fun throwback to my first-ever paid programming gig in 2007--
  building a course website for one of my professors when Rails was just a couple
  years old.
* Since August-ish, I've been working with Hologram on Developer Experience.
  In November we released a brand
  new [documentation site](https://hologram.io/docs/)!
* I had a small project helping a fellow member of
  [Pumping Station One](http://pumpingstationone.org) on some software for a 3D
  head-and-torso scanner. I didn't get involved until late in the project, but
  it got me jazzed about [3D
  scanning technology](https://twitter.com/mattmeshulam/status/811801934290124800).
* Speaking of PS:1, I started teaching the [ShopBot CNC
  class](/blog/2016/introduction-to-cnc/) there back in January.
  Over the course of the year I authorized over 100 people on the farily
  complex piece of equipment.
* Thanks to PS:1 and the ShopBot, I also had my first paid machinist job,
  helping a member make an enclosure for a product prototype he's developing.
* I was really all about the ShopBot last year--my 
  [Birdbath](/projects/CNC-birdbath/) was probably my most involved CNC project
  to date. And it also marked my return to making videos; the last time I spent
  serious time in an editing program was in high school.
* I played around with using Android devices as interfaces for embedded
  electronics projects (Arduino and similar). I got a prototype light controller
  working but lost momentum as I realized I don't like developing Android apps.
* On the more traditional craft/woodworking side, I made an [end grain cutting
  board](/projects/cutting-board/)!
* For Reverb, I developed an [interactive
  tour](https://interact.reverb.com/bonamassa/) of guitarist Joe Bonamassa's
  home and studio.
* I dipped my toe into Twitter bots with one that [replayed FiveThirtyEight's
  articles](https://twitter.com/538minus8) from eight years ago.
  [Code here](https://github.com/meshulam/replay-bot).
* In order to learn more about the Rust programming language and the internals
  of Git, I started re-implementing Git in Rust. [I didn't get very
  far](https://github.com/meshulam/grit).
* I designed and built some lampshades from laser-cut acrylic. Once PS:1's new
  big laser cutter comes online, I'm hoping to revisit that project.
* Toward the end of the year I started attending [Chi Hack
  Night](https://chihacknight.org/), where I've been working with the [Chicago
  Justice Project](http://chicagojustice.org/) on scraping and analyzing news
  coverage of crime in Chicago.
* And my final project of 2016: [Robby #1](/projects/robby-1/).
