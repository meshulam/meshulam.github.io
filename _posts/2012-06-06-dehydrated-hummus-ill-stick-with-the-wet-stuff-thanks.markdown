title: Dehydrated hummus? I'll stick with the wet stuff, thanks

During my packing and preparation for Bonnaroo, I decided to try making a quasi-nonperishable hummus mix that we could reconstitute with hot water while "camping." The secret ingredient, of course, is chickpea flour. I used the Bob's Red Mill stuff, which resulted in a much better texture than another brand I've tried. I haven't tested how shelf-stable the mix really is, but all the components can do just fine at room temperature for months or more. The only moisture in the mix is the small amount that's in tahini. I used citric acid instead of lemon juice to provide the acidity.

The recipe:

- 1 C chickpea (garbanzo bean) flour
- 1/4 C tahini
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/8 teaspoon citric acid
- 1/8-1/4 teaspoon garlic powder (or one clove garlic, minced)
- Other spices to taste (cumin, zatar, chili powder, etc)

Put all ingredients in a food processor and pulse for 30 seconds or so, until completely homogeneous. The consistency should be similar to cookie dough. When ready to use, add hot water in a ratio of about 3 parts mix : 2 parts water, and mix well.

The taste isn't quite as good as the real thing, since the chickpea flour has a slightly uncooked flavor. Overpowering this with spices is key. But you really can't beat the convenience.
