Lately I've been spending my free time doing fewer tech-related projects and more hands-on crafty stuff. The most time-consuming one has been a cross-stitch tribute to the Velvet Underground's first album:

{% include _image.html img="2012-01-29-IMG_20120126_200732_tknf3b.jpg" lightbox_img="2012-01-29-IMG_20120126_200732_tknf3b.jpg" title="Velvet Underground and Nico"  %}

I used a free program, [KG-Chart LE](http://www.iktsoft.net/kgchart-en/kgchart/), to make the design. After importing the image, I pretty much had to re-do the text manually so that the letters looked consistent. This was my first cross-stitch project, and while I'm happy with the end result, it took a little too much work to get there. I had a vision of making a bunch of album cover designs, but if I do another one, I'll need to scale it down to CD-size or so, especially if it has more than two colors and isn't 80% blank.

Another new item hanging in my living room is courtesy of the University of Chicago's [awesome online library of maps](http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/maps/). There's a ton of cool stuff to be found, especially if you're into Chicago history. I came across a [map from ~1930](http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/maps/chigov/G4104-C6S1-1930-C7.html) showing all of the pieces of land annexed into the city. After figuring out a way to download the full-resolution image, I got an 18x24" poster of it from my new friends at [The Ink Spot](http://www.inkspotchicago.com/) in Lakeview. It looks really cool:

Forgive the crappy photo quality; after nearly six years of service, my point-and-shoot camera finally died so I've been relying on my phone.

Finally, I've been playing around with etching glass after coming across [this tutorial](http://youseriouslymadethat.blogspot.com/2011/03/easy-etching-tutorial.html). No photos of that yet, though. Stay tuned.
