Apologies for the lack of posting, I'll have a more substantial post later today, but for now, something I came across on [BackstageJobs.com](http://backstagejobs.com/jobdetail.php?jobID=6961):

> Props person needed immediately for Bat Boy: The Musical, which opens May 29th.** Few items are difficult to locate: goose filled with blood, baby bat child, rabbit filled with blood, cow's head filled with blood.**

Sounds like a fun gig.
