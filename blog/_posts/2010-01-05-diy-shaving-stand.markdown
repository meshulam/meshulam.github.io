I've been shaving with a[ brush and safety razor](http://artofmanliness.com/2008/01/04/how-to-shave-like-your-grandpa/) for about two years now, and have been meaning to make a shaving stand for at least half that time. I finally got around to it, and I'm quite happy with how it came out. I wanted something that would hold both my brush and razor, and I thought it would be cool if it clipped onto the side of my shaving mug. I was afraid it would get in the way when I'm lathering up the brush, but it's not really an issue.

I made the stand out of brass-colored floral wire and two pairs of pliers. The wire is a little weaker than I would have liked, but it keeps its form well enough and it was super easy to work with. I've still got about 2/3 of the spool left, which will be useful if I ever get into steampunk.

In case you're wondering, the brush is from [The Art of Shaving](http://www.theartofshaving.com/) (genuine badger!) and the razor is a vintage Gillette that I inherited from my grandfather.
