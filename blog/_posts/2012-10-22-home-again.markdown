After a week away, I arrived back in Sweden yesterday. Since this was my first time traveling since I moved here, it was an interesting mindset change to fly into Stockholm as the last leg of a trip instead of the first. Despite the fast pace of the trip I did have some time to walk around and take some photos.Â I spent way too long today trying in vain to get nice looking image galleries in WordPress, so instead just click below to see the pictures via Picasa.
