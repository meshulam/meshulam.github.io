I know it's been a while since I rapped at ya, but finals season was keeping me busier than I expected. Now I'm back in Chicago for a few weeks so I hope to make up for my recent lack of posts. I'm going to warm up with a few short bloglets:

- As a followup to my [previous Megabus story]({% post_url 2008-12-01-has-megabus-outgrown-its-business-model %}), as I arrived at the St. Louis stop to travel to Chicago, I was greeted by a Megabus dispatcher. She couldn't have been more than a senior in high school, but there she was with her clipboard, checking people off. It made me feel old. But I have to hand it to Megabus, they've discovered a way to grow their operation while simultaneously reinforcing their image as a no-frills, DIY establishment. Child labor, is there anything it can't do?
- Speaking of transportation, picking up [Eve](http://evesthree.wordpress.com/) at the airport turned into a 4.5-hour trip because of a few inches of snow. I blame Rod Blagojevich.
- Speaking of politics, I can't say I'm super thrilled about the reports that Tom Vilsack has been chosen as the next Secretary of Agriculture. I'm sure we'll be hearing stories all day tomorrow about how he's a perfect choice because he's an environmentalist and still has good relationships with agrobusiness, but to me, the symbolism of choosing the former governor of Iowa as agriculture secretary leans a little more toward "more of the same" and less toward "change we can believe in."
- Speaking of the Department of Agriculture, the [NY Times had an op-ed](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/11/opinion/11kristof.html) a few days ago that called for the department to be renamed the "Department of Food." It goes into how the idea of an agriculture department is outdated and how the needs of the people actually eating all the food should be better represented. So much for that.
