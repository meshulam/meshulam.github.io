As I write this, I'm sitting in a hotel lobby in Sydney, Australia; on the last leg of a whirlwind world tour visiting customers for work. From my new home of Stockholm, I went to Hong Kong on Sunday, on to Singapore Tuesday night, and finally arrived in Sydney this morning. Despite a couple overnight flights and a nine-hour total time change, I'm still holding up pretty well. I'd be totally dreading the >20-hour return trip on Saturday, but I'm mercifully booked in business class; which, from my one prior experience, is exactly as great as it's made out to be.

Unfortunately the tight schedule hasn't allowed for much exploring but I have managed to take some photos. Stay tuned.
