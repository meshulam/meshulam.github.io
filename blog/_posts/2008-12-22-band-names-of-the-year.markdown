The Onion AV Club has published its [annual list of bad band names](http://www.avclub.com/content/feature/2008_the_year_in_band_names). I really recommend scrolling through as much of the six pages as you can bear, but here are some my favorites:

- Touched by a Janitor
- The Tao Jones
- Abracastabya
- Insects with Tits
- Eskimo Kisses for Mommy
- Piss Pissedofferson
- Sans Pants! Ska Band!
- Sigmund Droid
- Nacho Cheese And The Headgear Honeys
- Elf Lettuce
- E=MC Hammer
