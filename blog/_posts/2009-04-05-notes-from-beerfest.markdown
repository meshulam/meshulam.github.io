Yesterday I had the pleasure of attending [The Wine and Cheese Place's annual Beerfest](http://thewineandcheeseplace.blogspot.com/2009/01/twcp-beerfest-2009.html). Some highlights:

- [![img_2482](http://res.cloudinary.com/meshulam/image/upload/h_300,w_225/v1437619450/img_2482_ctzpuy.jpg "img_2482")](http://res.cloudinary.com/meshulam/image/upload/v1437619450/img_2482_ctzpuy.jpg)The beer of the day came from my favorite brewery, Bell's. Spring has barely sprung, but I can't wait for January again to get my hands on [Hopslam Ale,](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/287/17112) their seasonal double IPA. Bell's was also giving out awesome refrigerator magnets with an availability calendar for all their brews.
- Weirdest drinkable beer: Magic Hat's spring 2009 Odd Notion, a [poppy agave pilsner](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/96/47451). *A Classic European pilsner given a new springtime spin with wild sour accents of organic agave and natural blue poppy seeds planting a sweet, nutty balance. Our Poppy Agave Pilsner is summoned by a strengthening sun from two-row Pilsner malt and Noble hops. It melts snow and thaws souls with 30 IBUs and an ABV of 5%.* Maybe it was just because I had been tasting beers for two hours at this point, but I would probably buy a sixpack of this if it were sold in Missouri.
- Weirdest, least drinkable, beer: [Avery Mephistopheles Stout](http://www.averybrewing.com/BigBeers/seasonal/MephistophelesStout). Their rep proudly described this beer as "obnoxious." At 16% alcohol and over 100 [IBU's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bitterness_Units_scale), it'd be hard to disagree. I initially thought the meager sample sizes were a product of stinginess, it turned out to be mercy.
- With their 100% wind powered brewery and a remarkably in-depth [analysis of their carbon footprint](http://www.newbelgium.com/blog/post/carbon-footprint-6-pack-fat-tire-amber-ale), New Belgium is a model for "green" brewing. They upheld this image with their giveaways: <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_303" style="width: 310px">[![What's that?

Thanks to everyone at TW&CP for putting on such a great (free!) event. In conclusion, hooray beer!
