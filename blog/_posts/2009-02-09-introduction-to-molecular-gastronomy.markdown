...is not a required course for my pre-med friends. Molecular gastronomy, or "M.G." as it is often called, is the science of cooking. The term is also used to describe food created by avant-garde chefs who use non-traditional preparation techniques.

L2O's chef, Laurent Gras, writes a [blog](http://l2o.typepad.com/) documenting some of the things he's working on. There's also a [Flickr pool](http://www.flickr.com/groups/759455@N23/pool/) with shots of a lot of their dishes.

My homeland of Chicago happens to be a hotspot in the world of molecular gastronomy. In addition to L2O, Chicago is home to Grant Achatz's restaurant Alinea (gallery complete with unneccesary sideways scrolling [here](http://www.alinea-restaurant.com/pages/gallery/gallery_cuis.html)) and Moto, whose Willy Wonka-esque chef Homaro Cantu also runs a design firm to develop his cutting-edge food technologies. This short video featuring Cantu illustrates many of the techniques of this type of experimental food preparation:
