For the past few weeks, I've been building a Max/MSP patch to use in the final concert of my Electronic Music class. The patch is my version of a real-time sample recorder/looper/whatever, designed for creating abstract soundscapes as opposed to rhythmic/dance music. I'll cover the patch itself in more detail after the concert on Tuesday, but I thought I'd post a short demo I edited together from my experimentation. All the sounds were recorded by me, and the only transformations are speed and pitch shifts.

The performance will be slightly more structured than the demo; this is more an example of the variety (monotony?) of sounds that can be made.
