Did you know that coriander and cilantro are the same thing? I remember how my mind was blown when I first discovered that. Anyway, I was growing some cilantro on my balcony and neglected it during a particularly hot and dry period. It bloomed and went to seed, so I picked it and let it dry out inside for a week or so. I figured I could use the seeds as a spice; I'd never grown my own spices before!

Compared to the *Swad* brand seeds I normally use, these were larger and lighter colored, and didn't have as strong of a flavor. So while a fun experiment, I'll stick with store-bought coriander seeds.
