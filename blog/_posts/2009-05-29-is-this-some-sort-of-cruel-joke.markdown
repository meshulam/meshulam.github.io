The other day I got this email from the ol' alma mater promoting a career center-sponsored meet-and-greet-type event:  
{% include _image.html img="2009-05-29-rockbottom_evibn5.png" lightbox_img="2009-05-29-rockbottom_evibn5.png" caption="rockbottom" title="rockbottom"  %}
I'm not sure who came up with the idea of hosting a mini-career fair for a bunch of unemployed college graduates at a restaurant called Rock Bottom, but bravo. I'd love to attend, but I'll be busy collecting aluminum cans in an old shopping cart.
