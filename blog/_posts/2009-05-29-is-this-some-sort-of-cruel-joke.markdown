The other day I got this email from the ol' alma mater promoting a career center-sponsored meet-and-greet-type event:  
[![rockbottom](http://res.cloudinary.com/meshulam/image/upload/h_278,w_550/v1437619446/rockbottom_evibn5.png "rockbottom")](http://res.cloudinary.com/meshulam/image/upload/v1437619446/rockbottom_evibn5.png)

I'm not sure who came up with the idea of hosting a mini-career fair for a bunch of unemployed college graduates at a restaurant called Rock Bottom, but bravo. I'd love to attend, but I'll be busy collecting aluminum cans in an old shopping cart.
