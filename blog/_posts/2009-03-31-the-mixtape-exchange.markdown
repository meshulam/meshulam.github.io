</div>My friends at [Eleven Magazine](http://www.elevenmusicmag.com/) (warning: website perpetually under construction) are hosting a mixtape exchange tomorrow. Burn a CD with some tunes you like, and trade it in for a random stranger's CD. I take my mixes very seriously, so I've been spending a lot of time on the song selection and ordering of this one.

Making a mixtape for a random exchange is a bit different than the normal process, since you have no idea who will be listening to it. However, I had three general guidelines when I was assembling it: First, because I don't know the musical tastes of the recipient, variety was high priority. Secondly, I dug deep into my musical library; I didn't limit this mix to music I'm currently "into". Finally, since the ultimate point of a mixtape exchange is to discover new music, I tended toward the more obscure.

One final note: if you are the person who received my mixtape and typed in the URL on the CD to see the tracklist, I'd prefer if you listen to the album once through before reading any further. Thanks.

Now that that's out of the way, here's the tracklisting with brief commentary:

1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">D[evo - (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZXEVVX-RAw)</span>  
 A surprising number of people simply think of Devo as the band that does "Whip It." Their 1979 debut LP is still ahead of its time. Here's the opening track, a brilliant cover of the Rolling Stones tune.
2. [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hella - Republic of Rough and Ready</span>](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdPIfMO28ck)  
 For two guys, they sure make a lot of noise.
3. [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Detholz! - Kiss Me in Space</span>](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAcdJ9q-xnM)  
 Possibly my favorite Chicago band. Gotta love the theremin.
4. [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ween - I Gots A Weasel</span>](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czPde8oJghk)  
 I listen to Ween for the lyrics. Weasel teasel pleazel.
5. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Walter Taylor - Deal Rag</span>  
 From a really great compilation of pre-WWI recordings.
6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Books - An Animated Description of Mr Maps</span>  
 I read that they put a subwoofer inside a file cabinet to get the snare sound. That's pretty sweet.
7. [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cornelius - Breezin'</span>](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjRUjY7-5KM)  
 I wanted to put a song from Cornelius's album *Fantasma*, but all the songs transition into each other. Makes for a great album but poor mixtape fodder.
8. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tullycraft - 8 Great Ways</span>  
 Tullycraft is the epitome of twee. Doesn't get any better than this.
9. [<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The King Khan & BBQ Show - Zombies</span>](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3Sgq7bnmHI)  
 What's a mixtape without a song about zombies?
10. [Yelle - Ce jeu](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoY37T_nv5U)  
 Just discovered Yelle today. Like CSS, but French.
11. [Daniel Harris - ...And Benjamin Franklin, to Whom We Are Thankin, You Were Never Even President, Anyway](http://ithinkwethink.org/32bit_mp3s/12%20...and%20Benjamin%20Franklin,%20to%20whom%20are%20we%20thankin,%20you%20were%20never%20even%20president,%20anyway..mp3)  
 I've covered Daniel Harris [here](http://blog.meshul.am/2009/02/odds-n-ends-experimental-music-edition/) before. This is the closing track of his album, "Thirty-Two Bit Isn't Really Eight Bits Better" and I thought it worked quite well in that context.

Finally, to the recipient of the mixtape, if you're out there in internetland, care to post your reactions?
