So previously, I've reported on Google's bug that shows just-sent email as being sent "-1 minutes ago." The other day I sent an email and it appears they've cleaned up their act a bit:

**Old version:**

![future1](http://res.cloudinary.com/meshulam/image/upload/v1437619473/future1_kjvdyb.png "-1 minutes ago")

**New version:**

![gmailfuture](http://res.cloudinary.com/meshulam/image/upload/v1437619448/gmailfuture_wla5ik.png "in 1 minute")

Note that I don't have the "undo send" feature enabled.Â  I'd love to hear an explanation for this change. It would be easy enough to just round the time to "0 minutes ago," but instead they actually put forth a small amount of effort to make it perfectly clear that you're sending the email in the future.
