I just came across a fun little site called [StateStats](http://www.statestats.com), which uses Google's state-by-state search history data to correlate search terms with demographic information. [This article](http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/11/who-cares-about-our-obsessions-and-where-they-live-) from Silicon Alley Insider found a few good ones, such as that searches for "myspace" correlate moderately with state illiteracy rates.

A few good finds of my own:

- [Wine](http://statestats.appspot.com/?q=wine) has a strong negative correlation (-0.71) with the proportion of the population who voted for Bush in 2004, implying that wine is more popular in less Republican states. Interestingly, [arugula](http://statestats.appspot.com/?q=arugula) has the exact same correlation with the 2004 election, but it should be noted that there is a restaurant of the same name in Connecticut.
- Obviously, I also tried [latte](http://statestats.appspot.com/?q=latte) but was surprised to find that Minnesota blew past every other state for this search term. On a per capita basis, Minnesotans searched for "latte" 50% more than did the coffee mecca of Washington, its closest competitor.
- [Guns](http://statestats.appspot.com/?q=guns) have a 0.76 correlation with voting for Bush. I'll leave this one to the gun control groups, but that search also correlates 0.7 with suicide rates.
- [Meth](http://statestats.appspot.com/?q=meth) strongly correlates with the area of a state, and negatively correlates with the density of a state and its longitude. This leads to the intuitive finding that methamphetamine (or at least Google searches for it) is most prevalent in the mountain west region.
- I recalled Google's [Flu Trends](http://www.google.org/flutrends/) project, which hopes to track influenza outbreaks faster than any currently available system through finding regional variations certain searches. So I looked at the map for searches containing "influenza:"![](http://res.cloudinary.com/meshulam/image/upload/v1437619491/influenzamap_etq6pg.png "influenzamap")I suggest you get in contact with any friends or family that you may have in South Dakota.
