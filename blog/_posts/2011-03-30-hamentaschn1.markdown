The other day I made a batch of [Hamentaschen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamantash), a stuffed three-sided cookie eaten during the Jewish holiday of Purim. As illustrated above, I got a little experimental with the shape.

The dough was from a [Food Network recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/gale-gand/hamentaschen-recipe/index.html), and the filling was improvised, roughly as follows:

- 1 14-ounce package of baking dates
- 1 cup of walnuts, toasted and finely chopped
- 1/4 cup shredded coconut
- zest of 1/2 an orange
- 2-3 tablespoons fresh squeezed orange juice
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- Seeds from 3 cardamom pods, crushed

They may have been the best hamentaschen I've ever had. If I had to change anything, I'd probably ease up on the orange zest a little and maybe add more cardamom or other spices.
