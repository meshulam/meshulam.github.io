I got a new toy in the mail today:

[![PICkit-3](http://res.cloudinary.com/meshulam/image/upload/h_413,w_550/v1437619411/IMG_2786_vgk9kd.jpg "IMG_2786")](http://res.cloudinary.com/meshulam/image/upload/v1437619411/IMG_2786_vgk9kd.jpg)

A Microchip [PICkit-3 programmer/debugger](http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&nodeId=1406&dDocName=en538340) and [16F886 demo board](http://www.microchipdirect.com/productsearch.aspx?Keywords=DM164120-3).Â  I've worked with PICs and other microcontrollers on a handful of projects (most notably, the [EnerJar](http://enerjar.net)), but I've never owned my own programmer. I've got a few projects in mind, and one in particular that I'm sure you'll be hearing about shortly.

I'm still learning my way around Microchip's MPLAB development environment, but I'm hoping to get more comfortable with it so I'm not as intimidated to start a new project. Stay tuned...
