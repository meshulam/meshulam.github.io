A few months ago I was lucky enough to stumble upon Washington University's engineering course catalogs from as far back as 1980. Needless to say, there were tons of priceless photos of people using computers. I compiled the best of these photos and they can all be found at [this link](http://blog.meshul.am/80sPeopleAndComputers/). My hope is that captioned photos like the one above will become as popular as LOLcats. Post your own in the comments! You can use the [LOLbuilder](http://mine.icanhascheezburger.com/) provided by ICanHazCheezburger.com if you lack photoshop skillz. Remember, when LOLputers become the next big thing, you heard it here first.
