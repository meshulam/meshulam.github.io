I just was poking around CNN's election center and I noticed that even if McCain wins all of the states they classify as "battleground states," he'll still lose the election. I think there are a lot more swing states than the ones they list; they are probably using some very basic criteria for their classification. But I find it interesting how the media has an interest in making it seem like the election is close, even if their analysis shows the opposite.
