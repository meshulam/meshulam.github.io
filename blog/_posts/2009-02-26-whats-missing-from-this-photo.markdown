I'll give you a hint: doesn't that desk look pretty bare? This is 2009, remember. Shouldn't there be a cute little MacBook or something sitting front and center?

There were a few news cycles around inauguration time with stories about "Blackberry One." The press tried to sell the idea of the smartphone as a symbol, but the White House certainly isn't using it that way. I haven't seen any photos of Obama using it; in fact there hasn't really been any mention of it recently, let alone a discussion about the possibility of a real computer.

The conventional wisdom is that the President doesn't need a computer; all communications are conducted through staffers. But part of Obama's brand is that he's tech savvy and in touch with the people. I know they're posting the weekly address on YouTube, but if he really wants to put his money where his mouse is, he should be personally blogging or twittering at least daily. It sounds silly, but if the president had a *personal* presence online (as opposed to the great steps being taken to bring the White House website up-to-date), it would do wonders to keep young voters enthusiastic about Obama as an agent of change.
