I bought a sweet new bike pump and needed to get it home from my office, where it was delivered. I don't have a rear rack on my bike, so I had to get a little creative:

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_676" style="width: 269px">[![](http://res.cloudinary.com/meshulam/image/upload/h_300,w_259/v1437619408/IMG_3037_pq4xuq.jpg "Ingenuity!")](http://res.cloudinary.com/meshulam/image/upload/v1437619408/IMG_3037_pq4xuq.jpg)Pump taped to messenger bag

</div>It weathered the 8-mile ride just fine, and wasn't too uncomfortable. Packing tape: is there anything it can't do?
