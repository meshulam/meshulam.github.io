I bought a sweet new bike pump and needed to get it home from my office, where it was delivered. I don't have a rear rack on my bike, so I had to get a little creative:

Pump taped to messenger bag
</div>It weathered the 8-mile ride just fine, and wasn't too uncomfortable. Packing tape: is there anything it can't do?
