Lately I've been having a problem with staying focused while I'm working on the computer. It's pretty rare for me to stay in "the zone" for more than 15 or 20 minutes at a time. I took advantage of the new, very flexible task scheduler in Windows 7 to make the above notification window pop up every ten minutes, no batch scripts required. We'll see how well it keeps me from getting distracted, but I imagine it will be more annoying than helpful.
