One of my new year's resolutions is to bake more bread. A few months ago, I received a copy of the [Tassajara Bread Book](http://www.amazon.com/Tassajara-Bread-Book-Edward-Brown/dp/157062089X) by [Edward Espe Brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Espe_Brown). Brown is a Zen priest who leads retreats and cooking classes at the San Francisco Zen Center. The documentary [*How to Cook Your Life*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0943512/) is a great primer on Brown's Zen approach to cooking and baking.
Background info out of the way, let's get floury. The Tassajara book mainly uses a [sponge method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge_and_dough) for making bread, where part of the flour is added to the liquids and yeast, creating a batter or *sponge*, which sits for a bit before the rest of the flour is added to make the dough. At first I was a little resistant to this method, but once you do it a few times you get much faster at mixing in the flour, and supposedly it produces a better loaf.

The standard Tassajara yeasted bread recipe can be found [here](http://books.google.com/books?id=3CSkNr82k38C&lpg=PP1&dq=tassajara%20bread&client=firefox-a&pg=PT58#v=onepage&q=&f=false) via Google Books. I'm not going to bother writing out the whole process; I highly recommend getting a copy of the book if you're interested in baking bread. Below you'll find my photos and a few notes from my most recent batch, a sesame bread.

Since it's pretty cold in my house, I turn on the oven for 30 seconds or so and then let the bread rise in it. The warmer the air, the faster and higher the bread will rise, but I wouldn't go above 85 or 90 degrees F.

As I said above, this is the sesameÂ  bread variation (recipe #3 in the 25th anniversary edition of *Tassajara*). I pulsed about 2 cups of sesame seeds in a food processor until pretty much all the seeds were broken apart (a minute or 2). If you make your sesame meal from seeds as I did, be sure not to process them for too long or it will turn into tahini, or sesame paste.

Even though I have a pretty good feel for how much a dough will rise, I still get a kick out of taking the first peek and seeing that it doubled in size. Good work, yeast.

I need to work on forming the dough into loaves. As you can see, it doesn't quite fill up the whole area of the pan, which leads to a slightly lopsided loaf. It's just a matter of aesthetics; as long as you knead the dough a bit before putting it into the pans, the bread comes out just fine.

I didn't use an egg wash on the tops of the loaves, so it has a great rough texture. I'd highly recommend the sesame variation if you like halva or other sesame-flavored things. Lightly toasted, it makes for a delicious breakfast with greek yogurt, sliced tomatoes, and a bit of salt.
