I hope a graphic designer burns in hell for this. I wonder how many innocent yogurt buyers have fallen into the Banilla trap as I have. Leaving aside the discussion of the banana+vanilla flavor itself, I can't imagine how the Banilla packaging design passed through so many layers of approval without anyone thinking, "You know, this looks awfully similar to the vanilla design. A lot of people will probably get confused." It must be some secret deal between Stonyfield Farm and the banana mafia.
Since it wouldn't be very productive for me to just sit here complaining, I took it upon myself to redesign the Banilla yogurt packaging. Even if Stonyfield Farm doesn't use my design, I will still sleep soundly knowing that I did everything I could to correct this grave injustice.
