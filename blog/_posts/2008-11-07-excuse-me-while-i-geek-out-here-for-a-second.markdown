Buried deep within the Department of Music lies one of Washington University's best-kept secrets. [Rich O'Donnell](http://richodonnell.com/about/), former principal percussionist for the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, runs the electronic music studio, possibly one of the most badass collections of synthesizers-old and new-available to be used by college students in the country. Let's take a peek inside, shall we?

Here you can see (from left): old Mac G4 running ProTools; a Buchla Electric Music Box; THROD, a massive modular synth built by Rich in the 70's; and an ARP 2500. On top of the 2500 is its little brother, the 2600.

Here on the other side of the room you'll find a Korg WaveStation and a Korg Triton. On the right there's a Nord Modular G2, connected to a second Mac. This Mac also has Digital Performer, Ableton Live, and I think some other music production software on it. All inputs are directed to the patch bay next to the Nord for convenience, but I'm pretty sure there are some jacks that nobody knows where they go to.

Oh, and there's also a Moog modular on the back wall:

Some other goodies not pictured: 4-track tape recorder, a decade of Electronic Musician back issues, a wall of posters from local electronic music concerts, tube amps driving those monster JBL monitors, and various percussion instruments.

Rich refers to this place as "Fantasyland," and I must say I agree with him. It's certainly put my lonely [MicroKorg](http://www.korg.com/gear/info.asp?A_PROD_NO=microKORG) to shame.
