So as you may recall, I take the task of [creating mixtapes](http://blog.meshul.am/2009/04/the-mixtape-exchange/) very seriously. My most recent mix was an exchange with my friend Matt. This exchange presented a unique challenge, since our musical tastes are incredibly similar, and he keeps pretty good tabs on [my Last.fm profile](http://www.last.fm/user/capzloc). Despite these hurdles, I'm pretty happy with how the mix came out.

I started assembling the mixtape by comparing our Last.fm profiles, which keep track of every song we listen to. Out of the 100 artists I listen to most frequently, Matt had zero listens logged for 20 of them. I was able to toss out many of them based on what I know about his taste in music. Out of the 20 artists, I wound up putting five on the mix.

Then I did the same comparison, but looking at my top 100 artists over only the past six months. There were about 35 artists that Matt hadn't heard, which I found to be surprisingly high. Seven artists from the short-term list (but not in my overall top 100) made it to the mix. The remaining five songs either came from artists that I don't listen to very frequently, or artists that Matt had listened to once or twice, but not recently.

Enough analysis, here's the tracklist:
