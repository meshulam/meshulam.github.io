Due to overwhelming demand for updates regarding my experiences living in Sweden, I figured I should maintain some sort of blog, at least until I get bored with it and abandon the project, leaving my followers worried and confused. Since I already have this semi-abandoned blog, it makes sense to not create another one. If you are only here to read about my life in Sweden, just bookmark [http://blog.meshul.am/category/person/](http://blog.meshul.am/category/person/ "http://blog.meshul.am/category/person/"). You will then be spared my ramblings about Linux hacks, electronic music, baking, information design, and any other non-narcissistic topic I care to cover.

I just arrived in Stockholm about ten hours ago, so I haven't had much time to unpack/explore/settle in yet. I went straight from the airport to my home for the next month: a studio apartment just a few minutes' walk from my office. It's laid out like a hotel room with a tiny kitchen in a closet-sized room.

</div>...and the kitchen:

</div>After dropping off my stuff, I caught the tail end of the lunch special at a tapas restaurant near my apartment. Then I headed to the office to set up my desk and say hi to people.  At the office I also got my Swedish residence card, which has more watermarks and security features than every other ID card I own combined. I guess the Swedes take that kind of stuff seriously.

After work I stopped by Coop, one of the bigger grocery store chains in Stockholm. Even though I could have spent hours browsing the aisles, trying to decipher ingredient lists and compare the best values in terms of Krona-per-kilogram, I opted to make it a quick trip and just grab a few necessities. After all, I've got all the time in the world to find the best brand of pickled herring.

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_746" style="width: 560px">[![I bought this food... in Sweden!](http://res.cloudinary.com/meshulam/image/upload/h_413,w_550/v1437619391/groceries_memhi8.jpg "groceries")](http://res.cloudinary.com/meshulam/image/upload/v1437619391/groceries_memhi8.jpg)I bought this food... in Sweden!

</div>My haul consisted of olive oil, brown rice, potatoes, onions, cream cheese, tortellini, peanut butter (I am an American, after all), jam, yogurt, muesli, and of course a giant thing of Wasa crispbread.  Eating at restaurants is quite expensive here, so I was curious to see whether the cost of groceries was similarly high. All this cost 229 kr, or about $35. Probably a little more than this would cost in the US, but not all that outrageous. I guess I'll be doing a lot of cooking here. Good thing I packed my cast iron skillet.

p.s. re: skillet: the TSA really doesn't like it when you put a cast-iron skillet in your checked baggage. I opened up that suitcase to find a nice little note telling me that they searched the bag. I can only imagine what it looked like on the X-ray machine.
