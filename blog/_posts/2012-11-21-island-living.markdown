After a month and a half in a tiny temporary place, I've finally moved into my "real" apartment. It's a studio+kitchen on Kungsholmen, one of the islands in central Stockholm. I've never lived on an island before, so this is pretty exciting for me. I'm renting from the owner of the unit, a very friendly Swede named Tomas, who is taking a life gap year to travel the world.

I'm still settling in and deciding how I want to rearrange all the furniture, but it already feels quite homey thanks to Tomas' tasteful decor. See for yourself:

Need to hang some stuff on the walls. Also note: it's dark outside, as usual.

Where the magic happens.
