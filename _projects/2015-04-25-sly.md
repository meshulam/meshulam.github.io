A Python library for converting a 3D model into 2D parts that can
be constructed in real life.
Similar to Autodesk's [123D Make](http://www.123dapp.com/make).

I created Sly in order to generate patterns for my [Metropol Table](/projects/metropol-table/) project.
In March 2015, I spoke at the Chicago Python User Group (ChiPy) about Sly and how I used it to create the table.
