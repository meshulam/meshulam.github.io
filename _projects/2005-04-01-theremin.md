I built this theremin when I was 17 from [plans I found online](http://www.oldtemecula.com/theremin/).
It was my first electronics project, and quite an ambitious one at that. I
made the circuit board by ironing on a mask and etching away the exposed copper.
The two coils were hand-wound around PVC pipe. I used a kitchen whisk as the
antenna.

The sound is more distorted now than when I first built it, but it still works.
