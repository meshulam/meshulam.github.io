I designed a coffee table inspired by the [Metropol Parasol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropol_Parasol) in Seville, Spain. 
This was my first non-trivial project using the ShopBot CNC router, 
and also my first time using Blender to design a physical object.
I wrote a tool, [Sly](/projects/sly/), that takes a Blender model 
and generates a pattern that can be cut out on a CNC router.

In March 2015, I [spoke at the Chicago Python User Group (ChiPy)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib2n2msvVZk)
about Sly and how I used it to create the table.

The Metropol Table continues to serve as my living room coffee table.
