I designed a coffee table inspired by the [Metropol Parasol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropol_Parasol) in Seville, Spain. 
This was my first non-trivial project using the ShopBot, 
and also my first designing with Blender.
I wrote a Blender plugin, [Sly](), to generate the shapes
to cutout given a model of the shell.

In March 2015, I spoke at the Chicago Python User Group (ChiPy)
about Sly and how I used it to create the table.

The Metropol Table continues to serve as my living room coffee table.
